        Ecotourism is a type of tourism that focuses on responsible travel to
        natural places and environmental preservation. Ecotourism has a lot of
        potential in India right now, and it’s important to assist both the
        local people and the economy. It is a type of sustainable tourism that
        allows visitors to observe nature in its purest form. Tourists
        participating in ecotourism activities are more likely to engage in
        activities that are less invasive or detrimental to the ecosystem, as
        well as more ecological and respectful of the residents’ native
        culture.Also Read - Eco Tourism: 13 New Eco Retreats To Welcome

      <h2>Do’s of Eco-Tourism:</h2>
      <br></br>
      <div>
        Carry all non-biodegradable litter back with you, such as empty bottles,
        tins, plastic bags, and so on. These must not be dumped or littered in
        the environment. Respect the sacredness of sacred sites, temples, and
        local traditions. Reduce the amount of noise pollution. Radios, tape
        recorders, and other electronic entertainment devices should not be
        played loudly in nature resorts, sanctuaries, or wildlife parks. If
        portable toilets are placed near campsites, cover them with mud or sand
        after defecation.
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Don’t of Eco-Tourism:</h2>
      <br></br>
      <div>
        While cleaning and bathing, avoid using contaminants like detergent in
        streams or springs. When cooking at the campsite, avoid using wood as
        fuel. In the woods, do not leave cigarette stubs or build open fires. Do
        not consume aerated beverages, alcohol, narcotics, or other intoxicants,
        and do not discard bottles in the wild. Plastics and polythene are
        non-biodegradable and harmful to the environment, hence they should not
        be used or discarded.
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <h2>Here is how you can become an Eco-Tourist:</h2>
      <br></br>
      <div>
        Learn about all of the animals that live in that ecosystem, how to keep
        a safe distance from them, and what activities you can do without
        disturbing the ecology. Unruly conduct with local people, feeding
        animals, off-roading on wide spaces and grasslands, taking selfies with
        wild creatures, or throwing stones to see how they react should be
        avoided. Avoiding plastic as much as possible is a desirable habit to
        develop in everyday life, as well as a means to promote ecotourism in
        India. Try to bring back as little rubbish as possible while exploring
        rainforests. Dispose of items where they can be reused or recycled, or
        where they are the most appropriate.
